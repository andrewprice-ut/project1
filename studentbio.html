    Bio
    <br><br>
    Data analytics professional with a proven track-record of transforming complex data into insights that drive tangible results. A self-starter with a solid history of increasing revenue through carefully planned projects that optimize areas of greatest opportunity. My career began focusing on providing marketing analytics for a variety of clients such as Monster.com, Citi, and HomeAway where I identified multiple areas of opportunity that increased ROI and company revenue. Possessing a love for data has allowed me to build and manage my own analytics team from scratch at ad network Q1Media. Successfully, I transitioned into an analytics consultant role at Pivotal Analytics where I helped a number of small companies develop, manage, and analyze their company data. This experience encouraged me to develop and hone skills that are critical in data science, which include Python, SQL, VBA, Tableau, and much more. I believe that a well-rounded data analytics professional can add value to any industry if given the opportunity.

    Pitch
    <br><br>
    Hi, I’m Andrew and I’m a data analytics professional. Did you know that most companies have separate departments for data analysts and developers? This is primarily because data analysts are converting data into insights full-time, while developers are buried in code all day working hard to maintain the integrity of company data. My unique value-add is that I specialize in analyzing AND developing data! I’ve worked as a marketing analyst, an analytics manager, and an analytics consultant. My experience has provided me with a unique understanding of what it takes to drive results. The world revolves around data, and my most recent consulting position made me realize that big data is daunting, and many companies are still learning how to manage and comprehend it all. My skillset enables me to bridge the gap between data engineering and data analysis, making me an invaluable asset in the world of data science! I would love 20 minutes of your time to discuss how I can add value to your organization.
